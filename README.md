# Simple Mines - a Minesweeper-like game

## Frontend
- react single-page-application
- create a N-by-N grid with X number of bombs and T second countdown
- right-click sets/unsets a flag
- left-click uncovers the cell
- scenario 1: if cell contains a bomb, game over
- scenario 2: if cell does not contain a bomb, and is adjacent to the bomb, display the number of bombs it is next to
- scenario 3: otherwise expand all adjacent cells up/down/left/right until we run into cells in scenario 2

## Backend
