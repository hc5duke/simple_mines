# Simple Mines

Simple Mines is a classic puzzle game where the objective is to clear a grid of mines without detonating any of them. The game is played on a rectangular grid, where each cell can either contain a mine or be empty. The player can click on a cell to reveal its contents, or flag it as a potential mine with right-click.

## Gameplay

To do this, the player can click on a cell to reveal its contents. If the cell contains a mine, the game is over. If the cell does not contain a mine, the number of adjacent mines is revealed. The player can also flag a cell as a potential mine with right-click.
